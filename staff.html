<!-- Web Pages: As you know there have not been so many new movies so far in
2020. So an underdog movie like Sonic the Hedgehog has a real shot as best
movie of the year. Make an HTML 5/Living Standard validating, fan web page
with title Oscars for Sonic 2020 that represents why you think Sonic the
Hedgehog should take home as many Oscars as possible this year, including for
best picture. Here are some additional requirements for your page:
!!!Your page should use a <link> tag to specify a favicon. You should include
this icon in your Hw1.zip folder.
!!!Your page should have at least two <a> tags to two other HTML 5/Living
Standard validating pages you create. The href attributes in these tags
should use relative paths so it doesn't matter what folder your page is
served from.
!!!Your page should have at least one <img> tag that correctly loads a png image
that you include in your Hw1.zip folder. The src attribute of this tag should
use a relative path.
!!!Your page should at least once constructively use the following tags: <ul>,
<table>, <span>. You can use the span tag for example to give a tooltip for
some item on the page. -->
